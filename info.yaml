  top_module:  "opensource_fr_fuzzy_wavelet"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "An open source 'fuzzy' wavelet implementation"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Feeds the wavelet taps via moving averages in pipelined manner to reduce scaling costs, does a few math tricks to reduce module complexity"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "8-bit time series data 0-255 (0 maps to -128, 127 maps to -1,  128 maps to 0, 255 maps to 127), and watch the amplitude and phase from any single bank"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
